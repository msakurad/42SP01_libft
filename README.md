Project #1 in 42SP cursus - The Starter!

## Summary:
This project is about coding a C library.
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

## Notes

### Final Grade: 125/100
Mandatory + Bonus

### Directories
-- includes
Contains the header "tests.h", which specifies all the libraries, functions used for the testing of libft functions.

-- srcs
Contains all the functions - including bonus-, the Makefile and the "libft.h" header of the project.

-- srcs_others
Contains functions that I created but kept unfinished because I preferred to change the approach. In the end, I decided to keep those files for future inspiration.

-- tests
Contains the testing files associated to the libft functions.

-- Unity (hidden)
Contains the necessary files of the Unity Testing Framework (Throw The Switch). Without it, I wouldn't be able to test the functions in an organized way.
